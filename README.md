# Project Description 

Project that builds on top of the Session 6 homework: Build a simple webscraper. 

The project scrapes all the urls from the Wikipedia page: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dragons_in_mythology_and_folklore

And then scrapes all the images from each of the pages in the main page. 

A sample of the images are used as an input for the stable diffusion model,â€™sd-image-variations-diffusers.
